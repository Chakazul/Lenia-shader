WebGL Shader for SmoothLife

SmoothLife is a family of rules described in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1567">paper by Stephan Rafler</a>. It was designed as a continuous version of Conway's Game of Life. 

This SmoothLife ruleset uses these parameters: 

* Outer radius: 9
* Inner radius: 3
* Birth range: 0.27 - 0.34
* Survival range: 0.52 - 0.75
* Alpha_n (outer sigmoid width): 0.03
* Alpha_m (inner sigmoid width): 0.15
